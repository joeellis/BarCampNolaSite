A BIG thank you to all of our BarCampNola 4 [sponsors][1] who helped us make this possible!  \---|-- What is BarCampNola? 

## What is BarCampNola?

BarCampNola is a local incarnation of the international network of user generated conferences called <a href="http://barcamp.org/w/page/402984/FrontPage" target="_blank">BarCamps</a>.  
  
BarCamp is an ad-hoc gathering born from the desire for people to share and learn in an open environment. It is an intense event with discussions, demos, and interaction from attendees. It is an open event where each attendee is encouraged to participate and present. All content comes from the attendees and each workshop or presentation is scheduled on the day of the event, differentiating it from 'regular' conferences.  
  
BarCamp is an 'un-conference'. It is a meeting of the nerds/geeks who exchange information about what they are passionate about and share it with their peers. While it is encouraged to be somewhat technology oriented, all themes are welcome.

### What is BarCampNola? Right 

> BarCampNola brings talented people together in one location to exchange ideas, build connections, launch shared projects or initiatives, and generally assist in realizing the potential of the tech community here in New Orleans. It is both a showcase of our local talent as well as a mechanism to inspire others.

Option 1: get there early, or just get lucky and find some free off-street parking

Option 2: $10 a day parking in the lot at the corner of Magazine and Capdeville

Option 3: $6 a day parking in the lot at the corner of Magazine and St. Joseph \---|-- Locations Right

### Day One

* * *

So, our third year went off without a hitch. In fact, people actually complained that things went too smoothly. Lunch came on time this year, everyone actually had all those annoying adapters to connect their laptops to the projectors, all the presentations started on time and they even built a bar next door this year that opened up early just for us. We've heard your complaints next year we will try to make things a bit more chaotic.

But in the meantime, we want to thank you all for joining us to make this year the successful event it was. We all know <b style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">BarCampNola</b> is a community driven event, made possible by our [sponsors](http://barcampnola.org/sponsors/), and by YOUR participation. All our returning attendees knew what to expect but many of you came just on faith that there might be one or two of those presentations with that perfect bit of knowledge or inspiration you were looking for.

And for those of you who presented and came to share your ideas, we extend an extra special Thank You!

### Day Two

* * *

We had over 30 people show up for our day two Ã¬Hack Day.Ã® That's 0 people who started with nothing but a vague concept and the idea to give something back. In just a few hours, we were able to create a project we can all be proud of: <http://closingthenolagap.org/>

ClosingTheNolaGap.org is an online community for the educators working to close the achievement gap in New Orleans public schools. They do this by sharing knowledge and resources and  are committed to providing a college-prep education to every child in New Orleans and will not settle for less.

For a look behind the scenes of our Hack Day check out this brief video:


## BarCampNola ++

July 18th and 19th, 2009, at LaunchPad

![barcampnola][3]

Below is a quick wrap-up of the events of the day. Just the facts....

# Day One:

We are 'guestimating' an attendance of <span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">approximately</span> 70+ people on day one. The sign-in sheet contains 57 names, and we all know that got overlooked in the excitement that morning. All presentation time-slots for each four of the rooms were quickly filled up, and at any point during the day you could walk into a room filled to capacity. Below, are only a few examples of the high level of presentations.

# New Groups

In addition to the second day workshop and the presentations on day one, there was a lot of discussion about how to continue the momentum and excitement generated from BarCampNola. The formation of GNOCode was announced and a new user group for ruby was discussed 

#### GNOCode

We will be having the first meeting of GNOCode late August.

Barret Conrad has started our site at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gnocode.org/">http://www.gnocode.org/</a> and we already have the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.meetup.com/gnocode/">meetup group</a>

We are a group of software and web developers from the Greater New Orleans area with the goal to bring together eager professionals and amateurs to share and learn. Our group welcomes developers from all backgrounds, platforms and fields. 

#### Ruby Bayou

James Thompson is gathering momentum to start a RUBY user group.

All interested programmers should contact James via <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/plainprogrammer">@plainprogrammer</a> or visit the site at <a target="_blank" href="http://rubybayou.com/">http://rubybayou.com/</a> 

#### Hacker Space

Although not a product of this years event, be sure to also check out <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/simondorfman">Simon Dorfman's</a> initiative to create a Hacker Space here in New Orleans with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gumbolabs.org/">Gumbo Labs.</a>

# Day Two:

The day two workshop far exceeded anyone's expectations this year. We have 27 people who signed the list, which we only brought out late in the day.

Despite the large number of participants and the deadline of 4:00, we were able to accomplish the goal of creating the website we wanted in only 6 hours.

Everyone who attended can be proud of their efforts in creating a new site to highlight the efforts of all involved in the volunteer effort to make our New Orleans public schools a better place for the students. 

### <a href="http://www.nolaschoolvolunteers.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 150%;">http://www.nolaschoolvolunteers.org/</span></a> 

#### Live Blog

Check out the <a href="http://www.gatorworks.net/art/live-blog-barcamp-nola-2009" target="_blank">live blog</a> from that day maintained by one of our sponsors GatorWorks.

GatorWorks also stepped up and offered to host the new site, and pay for the domain registration.

#### Planning Wiki

We used the following <a href="http://ryandlane.com/sandbox/Wordpress_info" target="_blank">wiki</a> to keep our efforts organized throughout the day.

It was an invaluable scrib sheet for our ideas and brainstorming efforts, provided by Ryan Lane.

#### Open Issues

We are keeping track of open issues from day two on <a target="_blank" href="http://ryandlane.com/wprdl/2009/07/20/bug-tracking-post-for-nolaschoolvolunteers-org/">Ryan Lane's blog.</a>

#### The Team

And last but not definitly not least, the list of all team members and a picture from that day can be found on the <a href="http://www.nolaschoolvolunteers.org/2009/07/19/barcampnola/" target="_blank">volunteer site</a> itself.

I think all of us who participated know it would be impossible to list each of us by name and accomplishment.
